    **Wallet Customization**

    Developers can control the built-in Arcana Wallet UI theme and style to suit their branding requirements. In addition, there are wallet UI configuration options that control wallet visibility, how and when the wallet is displayed within the app context. It can be used to tailor the user experience for signing blockchain transactions.

    There is added flexibility that allows developers to replace the built-in wallet UI with custom Wallet UI. For details, see here.
